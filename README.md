Introduction to Datomic workshop, Java version

Might be a good idea to do this *before* the workshop takes place:

Clone this repository

Install [Maven](http://maven.apache.org)

And run the tests (exercises):

    mvn test

The timeTravel test will fail, because:

    expected:<[Cristiano Ronald]o> but was:<[Samuel Eto']o>

But that's allright, you'll fix that during the workshop.
